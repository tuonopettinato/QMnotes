# QMnotes

Lo and behold, some lecture notes on Quantum Mechanics. I am not the only author: this music has been played with eight hands!

Authors:
- Valerio Caporioni
- Davide Chiego
- Alessandro Gori
- Marco Pompili

We all wish to thank Professor Ettore Vicari and Professor Vincenzo Alba for their dedication.

Obviously, the notes contain typos and errors, so we'll gratefully accept recommendations. 

We'll also try to expand this work and to share the .tex files as soon as we can.
